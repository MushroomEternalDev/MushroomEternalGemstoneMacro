Description: Hypixel Skyblock aotv gemstone macro mod. 

How To Setup: Set coordinates for your route in skytils (if you need download, then go to Mods-I-use-On-Hypixel). When doing the route the first position (starting block) should be named "gem1" then next position named "gem2" etc... Next share the skytils route. Copy the random sting of characters. Then do /ME to see the config and set the core to gemstone macro. Go into the settings of gemstone macro and paste it into the box called "Gemstone Route". Finally, stand on the first coordinate and do /ME ON to start the macro. The chat will pop up with the options "setup route" and "start aotv gem macro". If the route needs dug out select the first option. If the route is dug out select the second option.
